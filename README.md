ðŸ‘‹ I'm recently completed pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Washington State University.
I primarily work with _C/C++_, _HTML/CSS_, and _JavaScript_ right now as a result of my required coursework. However, I also have experience with _C#_, _Python_, _Java_, _Haskell_, _R_, and spend a lot of my free time creating with _Lua_.
You can find a showcase of some of my personal projects in my [Portfolio Website](https://josh-abbott.github.io).
