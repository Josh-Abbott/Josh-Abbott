ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Washington State University.
I primarily work with _C/C++_ and _Python_ right now as a result of my required coursework. However, I also have experience with _Java_, _Haskell_, and spend a lot of my free time creating with _Lua_.
